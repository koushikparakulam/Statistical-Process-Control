Balancing Targets For Stateful LSTM

    A balanced dataset of in/out of dist data is neccessary for training generalization
    A random shift point will yield different breakdowns of windows/sequences leading to imbalance

    Randomly sample shift points from 50 to 400 and have equal in/out points

    This may not allow for predictive capability, in which case the shift points need to be sampled from a higher point
    --OR--
    A stateless LSTM must be used where no prior knowledge is known
    --OR--
    A stateful imbalanced dataset can be used but with a weighted loss function (more complex and needs precise tuning)
