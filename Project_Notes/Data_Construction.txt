Data Construction Workflow

    All Train/Test/Validation data will be stratified based on distributional overlap between (distA/distB)
    This ensures that training set has a consistent representation of all distributional shifts for generalization

    Input Training Data will be in the form of:
        - All batches of all dist shifts and all distB
        - A batch containing datapoints with some distB shift occurring at (shift_x) and some distB
            - The total datapoints (t_d_p) will of size (1000 + shift_x)

    Input Data will be given one by one

        - Once the data fills a window size (win_x), statistics for said data is calculated
        - Once all windows within the sequence_length (seq_len) is filled with stats

            - The corresponding statistics for each window will be given to the LSTM
            - The model will predict the shift/non-shift across all windows
            - The earliest prediction can thus not be made until (win_x*seq_len) is reached
