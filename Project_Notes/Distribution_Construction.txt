Distribution Construction Workflow
    - Standard Normal
    - t
    - lognormal
    - Exponential
    - Gamma
    - Weibull
    - Uniform
    - Beta

    Use some range for distB for each of the distributional variants

    Obtain a mixture of variants and determine their overlap percentage
        - Using this overlap percentage sample (x) random samples from each percentage bin (5%, 95%)
        - Stratify on these samples

    Use Kernel Density Estimation to estimate distA and distB for each of the windows
        - Using this kernel density estimation calculate the statistics between the distA and distB
